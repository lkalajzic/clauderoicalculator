   - Volume/scale information

## Format Requirements

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{{
  "companyInfo": {{
    "name": "Company name",
    "industry": "Specific industry",
    "size": "Size category (Enterprise/Mid-market/SMB) or specific employee count",
    "region": "Geographic location"
  }},
  "implementation": {{
    "useCase": "Detailed description of how Claude was implemented",
    "problem": "Specific business problem being addressed",
    "model": "Claude model used (if specified)",
    "integrationMethod": "How Claude was integrated (if mentioned)",
    "implementationTime": "Time taken to implement the solution (if mentioned)"
  }},
  "outcomes": {{
    "metrics": [
      {{
        "value": "Specific numeric or percentage value",
        "metric": "What was measured (INCLUDE FULL CONTEXT)",
        "sourceText": "Exact quote from the case study containing this metric"
      }}
    ],
    "qualitativeBenefits": [
      {{
        "benefit": "Description of benefit",
        "detail": "Specific example or evidence",
        "sourceText": "Exact quote from the case study"
      }}
    ],
    "timeToValue": "How quickly value was realized (if mentioned)",
    "roi": "Return on investment information (if available)"
  }},
  "technicalDetails": {{
    "architecture": "System architecture details (if provided)",
    "promptEngineering": "Insights into prompt design (if mentioned)",
    "challenges": "Implementation challenges faced",
    "solutions": "How challenges were overcome",
    "scale": "Volume or scale information (if mentioned)"
  }},
  "confidenceScore": {{
    "overall": "1-5 rating of your overall extraction confidence",
    "metrics": "1-5 rating of confidence in metric extraction",
    "companyInfo": "1-5 rating of confidence in company information",
    "implementation": "1-5 rating of confidence in implementation details"
  }},
  "metadata": {{
    "source": "URL or title of the case study",
    "extractionDate": "Current date",
    "version": "1.0"
  }}
}}
```

## Important Rules:
1. NEVER return metrics without both value and full context
2. ALWAYS include source text for any metrics or qualitative benefits
3. Set NULL or "Not mentioned" for fields without information
4. Be specific and detailed in all fields
5. Do not hallucinate or infer information not in the source
6. Include confidence scores (1=low, 5=high) for key extraction categories
7. For metrics, capture BOTH the numeric value AND what was being measured
8. Extract ALL metrics mentioned in the case study, not just a selection

For each metric, ensure you capture three components:
1. The precise value (25%, 2x increase, etc.)
2. What exactly was measured (response time, customer satisfaction, etc.)
3. The exact quote from the source text containing this information

Example of good metric extraction:
```
{{
  "value": "40%",
  "metric": "reduction in response time to customer inquiries",
  "sourceText": "We saw a 40% reduction in response time to customer inquiries after implementing Claude."
}}
```

Example of poor metric extraction (missing context):
```
{{
  "value": "40%",
  "metric": "reduction",
  "sourceText": "We saw a 40% reduction."
}}
```
