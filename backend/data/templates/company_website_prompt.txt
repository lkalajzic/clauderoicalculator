# Company Website Analysis

You are an expert business analyst tasked with analyzing a company's website to extract information for potential AI implementation opportunities. Analyze the provided website content to identify key business characteristics with particular focus on employee roles and distribution.

## Instructions
Analyze the HTML content below and extract the following information:

1. Company Information:
   - Company name
   - Industry (be specific and use standardized categories)
   - Approximate company size (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise based on clues)
   - Total number of employees (provide a specific estimate if mentioned)
   - Geographic focus (global, regional, specific markets)
   - Founded year (if mentioned)

2. Employee Role Distribution:
   - Identify the breakdown of employees across key roles
   - For each role category, estimate number and percentage of total employees
   - CRITICAL: Ensure the sum of all role counts EXACTLY matches the total employee count
   - If you need to estimate, adjust the largest categories to ensure the total matches
   - Provide confidence level for each estimate
   - Use ONLY these 9 standardized business functions:
     * Executive/Leadership (executives, senior leadership, C-suite, VPs)
     * Sales (sales representatives, sales team, account executives, BDRs, SDRs)
     * Marketing (marketing professionals, content creators, marketing team, growth team)
     * Product & Engineering (software engineers, developers, product managers, designers, IT, DevOps, QA, data scientists)
     * Operations (operations staff, administrative staff, project managers, supply chain)
     * Finance & Accounting (finance team, accounting, FP&A, controllers, treasury)
     * Human Resources (HR, recruiting, talent acquisition, people operations)
     * Legal & Compliance (legal officers, compliance team, risk management, regulatory)
     * Customer Support (customer success, support representatives, customer service, help desk)
   
   IMPORTANT: 
   - Map all job titles to these 9 categories only
   - ALWAYS return ALL 9 categories in roleDistribution, even if count is 0
   - Sort roleDistribution by employee count (highest to lowest)
   - The sum of all role counts MUST equal totalEmployees.count
   - If you're uncertain about exact distributions, use typical industry ratios but ensure they sum correctly
   - Examples:
     * "software engineers" → Product & Engineering
     * "customer success" → Customer Support
     * "data analysts" → Product & Engineering
     * "business intelligence team" → Product & Engineering
     * "data analysts and business intelligence team" → Product & Engineering
     * "product managers and designers" → Product & Engineering
     * "other operations and administrative staff" → Operations

3. Business Focus:
   - Primary products or services
   - Target customer segments
   - Value proposition
   - Key differentiators

4. Technical Infrastructure Indicators:
   - Technologies mentioned
   - Digital maturity indicators
   - Current automation level
   - Integration capabilities mentioned

5. Business Challenges:
   - Pain points mentioned
   - Scaling challenges
   - Efficiency issues
   - Customer experience challenges
   - Market challenges

6. AI Implementation Opportunities:
   - Role-specific automation potential:
     * Executive/Leadership: strategic analysis, report generation, decision support
     * Sales: prospect research, proposal generation, follow-up automation
     * Marketing: content generation, repurposing, analysis
     * Product & Engineering: code assistance, documentation, testing, DevOps automation
     * Operations: process automation, workflow optimization, data analysis
     * Finance & Accounting: financial analysis, report generation, compliance
     * Human Resources: recruitment support, employee communications, policy drafting
     * Legal & Compliance: document review, contract analysis, compliance checking
     * Customer Support: ticket handling, response drafting, knowledge retrieval
   - Content generation needs
   - Customer service optimization
   - Data analysis requirements
   - Document processing volume
   - Research and information needs
   - Other potential Claude use cases
